Immerse yourself in language learning: Talk freely on your chosen topics, get live feedback, and engage with a smart conversation partner in multiple languages. Learn your way with PatterPal!

## How it works
PatterPal is a web application that allows you to practice your speaking skills in a foreign language. *It's like having a language teacher just for yourself.*  PatterPal will listen to you and give you feedback on your pronunciation and fluency, while also talking with you about your chosen topic.
